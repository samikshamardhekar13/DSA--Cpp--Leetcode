# Approach
This solution uses:
  1.Two-pointer technique
  2.Character filtering
  3.Case-insensitive comparison

# Algorithm
1.Initialize two pointers:
  start at the beginning of the string
  end at the end of the string
2.While start < end:
  Skip characters that are not alphanumeric.
  Compare characters at start and end after converting both to lowercase.
  If they differ, return false.
3.If all valid characters match, return true.

EXAMPLE:
Input
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"

Output
true
