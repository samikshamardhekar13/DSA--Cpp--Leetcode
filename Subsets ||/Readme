# Approach
This solution uses backtracking with sorting and skipping duplicates.
Key Ideas:
1.Sort the array first
  Groups duplicate elements together
2.Backtracking
  At each index, choose to include or exclude the current element
3.Skip duplicates during exclusion
  Prevents generating the same subset multiple times

EXAMPLE:
Input
nums = [1,2,2]

Output
[1,2,2]
[1,2]
[1]
[2,2]
[2]
[]
