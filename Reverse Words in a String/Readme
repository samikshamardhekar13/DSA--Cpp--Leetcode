# Approach Used
This solution reverses the entire string first, then reverses each word individually to restore correct word spelling while keeping the word order reversed.

#Steps
1.Reverse the whole string s.
2.Traverse the reversed string character by character.
3.Extract each word (sequence of non-space characters).
4.Reverse the extracted word.
5.Append it to the answer string with a single space.
6.Remove the extra leading space before returning the result.

EXAMPLE
Input:
s = "  hello   world  "

Output:
"world hello"
