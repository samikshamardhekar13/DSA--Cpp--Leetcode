Given a 2D matrix where:
Each row is sorted in ascending order
The first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row

 # Approach
The solution uses two-level Binary Search:
1. Binary Search on Rows
  Treat each row as a range
  Find the row where: mat[row][0] ≤ target ≤ mat[row][n - 1]

2. Binary Search within the Row
   Once the correct row is found, perform binary search on that row
   This avoids flattening the matrix and keeps the logic simple and efficient.

EXAMPLE
Input
matrix = [
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 60]
]
target = 3

Output
true
