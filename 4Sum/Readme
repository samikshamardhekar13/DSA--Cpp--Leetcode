# Approach
1.This solution uses a sorting + two-pointer technique:
  Sort the array to make duplicate handling easier.
  Fix the first two elements using nested loops.
2.Use two pointers (p and q) to find remaining two numbers.
3.Skip duplicates at every level to ensure unique quadruplets.
4.Use long long to prevent integer overflow.

# Algorithm Steps
1.Sort the input array.
2.Loop over i from 0 to n-1
  Skip duplicates for i
3.Loop over j from i+1 to n-1
  Skip duplicates for j
4.Initialize two pointers:
  p = j + 1
  q = n - 1
5.While p < q:
  Compute the sum of four numbers
  Move pointers based on comparison with target
  Store valid quadruplets
  Skip duplicate values for p

EXAMPLE:
Input
nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2]
target = 0

Output
[
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2],
  [-1,  0, 0, 1]
]
