# Approach
1.The array must be sorted.
2.The search space is divided into two halves at every step.
3.If the middle element matches the target, return its index.
4.If the target is greater than the middle element, search the right half.
5.If the target is smaller, search the left half.
6.If the element is not found, return -1.

EXAMPLE:
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7

Output:
3
