# Two Sum (LeetCode)

## Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

## Approach (Simple Words)
- We use a map to store numbers with their indices.
- For each number, we check if `target - current number` already exists.
- If yes, we return both indices.

## Data Structures Used
- Vector
- Unordered Map

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Language
C++
