# Approach
This solution uses recursion + backtracking to generate all subsets.
At each index, we make two choices:
1.Include the current element in the subset
2.Exclude the current element from the subset
By exploring both choices for every element, we generate all possible subsets.

EXAMPLE:
Input
nums = [1, 2, 3]

Output
[1,2,3]
[1,2]
[1,3]
[1]
[2,3]
[2]
[3]
[]
