# Approach
We traverse the matrix layer by layer using four boundaries:
  srow → starting row
  erow → ending row
scol → starting column
ecol → ending column
At each step, we traverse:
1.Top row (left → right)
2.Right column (top → bottom)
3.Bottom row (right → left) (only if rows remain)
4.Left column (bottom → top) (only if columns remain)
  After completing one layer, we shrink the boundaries and repeat until all elements are visited.

# Algorithm Steps
1.Initialize four pointers for matrix boundaries.
2.Loop while srow <= erow and scol <= ecol.
3.Traverse:
  Top row
  Right column
  Bottom row (if valid)
  Left column (if valid)
4.Update boundaries after each spiral layer.
5.Store visited elements in a result vector.

# Boundary Case 
While traversing the matrix in spiral order, special care must be taken to avoid duplicate elements when the matrix reduces to a single row or a single column.
Why Boundary Checks Are Needed
During spiral traversal:
 1.The top row and bottom row may become the same
 2.The left column and right column may become the same
If we blindly traverse all four directions, elements at the corners will be added more than once.

EXAMPLE
Input
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]

Output
[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
